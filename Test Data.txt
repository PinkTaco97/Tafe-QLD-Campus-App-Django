Title: The Spit
Description:
The spit is a beautiful place to visit, go for a walk, swimming, sun bathe, fish or soak up the scenery. We live locally and visit the spit often, today we found a nice little spot off the main road to walk through the sand and admire some beautiful sights. Itâ€™s worth the visit and is a good way to unwind and relax by the water or on the sand.
